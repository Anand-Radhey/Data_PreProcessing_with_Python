    "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. \n",
    "The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. \n",
    "Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, \n",
    "all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n",
